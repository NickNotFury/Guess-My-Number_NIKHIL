It is a simple game built using HTML5, CSS3 and javascript.
I have used basic DOM manipulation(like selecting and manipulating different classes and elements) and event handling(adding click event and their functions to the buttons).

This game is simple and easy to play:- 
1) You only have to guess the number between 1 to 20, 
2) You can check your guesses using check button and if guessed wrong, it will tell if your number is less than or greater than the original number.
3) For every wrong guess your score gets deducted by 1 and it continues for every wrong guess until it reaches 0 and you lose the game.
4) If guessed correct at any point, the highscore gets set to the current score.
5) If you have to play again, click on again button and the new secret number gets generated and you have to guess again to beat the current highscore.
6) The highscore gets updated when you beat the old one.
